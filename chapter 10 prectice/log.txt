Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
Jab main saat saal ka tha, meri maa ne mujhe kaha
"Go make yourself some friends, or you′ll be lonely"
"Jao apne dost banao ya tum akele reh jauge"
Once I was seven years old
Jab main saat saal ka tha
verse
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Duniya bohot badi thi, par hume laga hum bhi bade hai
Pushin' each other to the limits, we were learnin′ quicker
Ek dusre ko hadon tak aazma rahe the, jaldi seekh rahe the
By 11, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin′ liquor
11 बजे तक, धूम्रपान जड़ी बूटी और पीने, शराब जलाना
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
Kabhi ameer nahi the toh woh banne chale
chorus
Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
Jab 11 saal ka tha, mere daddy ne kaha
"Go get yourself a wife, or you′ll be lonely"
"Apne liye humsafar dhundho ya akele reh jauge       python
Once I was 11 years old
एक बार, मैं 11 साल का था
